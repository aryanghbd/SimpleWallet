# SimpleWallet
A Simple Shared Wallet project developed as part of the Etherium Developer course - to sharpen my web3/Crypto development skills.

The Project consists of a decoupled Smart Contract consisting of a Wallet able to be shared across different accounts (e.g for a family, business etc), with allowances/budgets able to be set from an administrative level.
